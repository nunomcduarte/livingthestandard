## Test Coverage by Category

### 1. Helper Functions (9 tests) ✅

**Bitcoin Price Retrieval:**
- ✅ Returns correct monthly prices for valid years (2015-2024)
- ✅ Handles all 12 months correctly (0-11 index)
- ✅ Uses fallback price for years outside data range

**Date and Timing Functions:**
- ✅ `getDaysInMonth()` returns correct days including leap years
- ✅ `shouldPaySalary()` identifies salary payment days correctly
- ✅ `shouldPaySalary()` handles month-end edge cases (day 31 in February → day 28/29)
- ✅ `shouldPayExpense()` identifies monthly expense days with same month-end handling
- ✅ `shouldPayExpense()` identifies weekly expense days (Sunday=0 to Saturday=6)
- ✅ Correctly counts weekly occurrences (e.g., 4 Sundays in January 2020)

### 2. Scenario 1: Euro-Only Balance (4 tests) ✅

- ✅ Correctly calculates final balance (salary - expenses)
- ✅ Allows negative balance when expenses exceed income
- ✅ Handles zero salary correctly
- ✅ Handles zero expenses correctly

**Key Verification:**
```
Input: €3000 salary, €1000 rent, €500 food
Expected: €3000 - €1000 - €500 = €1500
Actual: €1500 ✅
```

### 3. Scenario 2: Bitcoin (No Selling) (4 tests) ✅

- ✅ Converts all positive EUR balance to Bitcoin immediately
- ✅ Accumulates Bitcoin from multiple salary payments
- ✅ Deducts expenses from EUR before converting to Bitcoin
- ✅ Never sells Bitcoin (amount only increases or stays same)

**Key Verification:**
```
Input: €7200 salary at BTC price €7200
Expected: Converts to 1 BTC
Actual: ~1.000000 BTC ✅

Input: €7200 on Jan 1 (price €7200), €7200 on Feb 1 (price €9650)
Expected: 1 + 0.746 = ~1.746 BTC
Actual: ~1.746 BTC ✅
```

### 4. Scenario 3: Bitcoin (With Selling) (6 tests) ✅

- ✅ Sells Bitcoin when EUR cash is insufficient for expenses
- ✅ Uses EUR cash first before selling Bitcoin
- ✅ Handles complete Bitcoin depletion (goes to zero)
- ✅ Correctly calculates Bitcoin amount to sell (shortfall / btcPrice)
- ✅ Handles insufficient Bitcoin (sells all, then uses remaining EUR)
- ✅ Handles multiple small Bitcoin sales correctly

**Key Verification:**
```
Input: €7200 salary → 1 BTC, then €3600 expense (exactly 0.5 BTC worth)
Expected: Sells 0.5 BTC, keeps 0.5 BTC
Actual: ~0.5 BTC remaining ✅
```

### 5. Inflation and Growth (4 tests) ✅

- ✅ Salary growth compounds annually (not simple interest)
- ✅ Expense inflation compounds annually (not simple interest)
- ✅ Both compound independently when applied together
- ✅ First year uses multiplier of 1.0 (no adjustment)

**Key Verification:**
```
Input: €3000 salary, 10% growth, 3 years + 1 month
Year 1: €3000 × 12 = €36,000
Year 2: €3,300 × 12 = €39,600 (3000 × 1.1)
Year 3: €3,630 × 12 = €43,560 (3000 × 1.1²)
Year 4: €3,993 × 1 = €3,993 (3000 × 1.1³)
Expected Total: €123,153
Actual: €123,153 ✅
```

### 6. Percentage Calculations (4 tests) ✅

- ✅ Calculates positive Bitcoin gain percentage correctly
- ✅ Handles division by zero (Euro balance = 0)
- ✅ Uses absolute value when Euro balance is negative
- ✅ Calculates separate percentages for Scenario 2 and Scenario 3

**Key Verification:**
```
Formula: ((bitcoinBalance - euroBalance) / |euroBalance|) × 100

Edge Case 1: euroBalance = 0, bitcoinBalance > 0
Expected: 100%
Actual: 100% ✅

Edge Case 2: euroBalance = 0, bitcoinBalance = 0
Expected: 0%
Actual: 0% ✅

Edge Case 3: euroBalance = -1000
Expected: Uses |-1000| = 1000 as denominator
Actual: Correct (no division by zero) ✅
```

### 7. Data Points and Chart Data (6 tests) ✅

- ✅ Stores all days for daily precision
- ✅ Samples appropriately for monthly precision
- ✅ Always includes the final data point
- ✅ Limits chart data to ~50 points for performance
- ✅ Rounds chart values to integers
- ✅ Includes all three scenarios in chart data

**Key Verification:**
```
Input: 31 days, daily precision
Expected: 31 data points
Actual: 31 data points ✅

Input: ~1461 days (4 years), daily precision
Expected: Chart data ~40-60 points (sampled)
Actual: Chart data ~50 points ✅
```

### 8. Edge Cases (9 tests) ✅

- ✅ Single-day simulation
- ✅ Multi-year simulation with year transitions
- ✅ Leap year handling (February 29, 2020)
- ✅ Non-leap year handling (February 28, 2021)
- ✅ Simulation starting mid-month (missed payments)
- ✅ Very small Bitcoin amounts (0.00001 BTC)
- ✅ Very large balances (€1,000,000)
- ✅ Month-end salary/expense payments
- ✅ Year boundary transitions for inflation multipliers

**Key Verification:**
```
Edge Case: Salary day 31 in February 2020 (leap year)
Expected: Pays on Feb 29
Actual: Pays on Feb 29 ✅

Edge Case: Salary day 31 in February 2021 (non-leap year)
Expected: Pays on Feb 28
Actual: Pays on Feb 28 ✅

Edge Case: Start simulation on Jan 10, salary day is Jan 1
Expected: Missed salary (€0 received)
Actual: €0 received ✅
```

### 9. Regression Tests (3 tests) ✅

- ✅ Processes expenses every day even with monthly precision
- ✅ Maintains balance consistency across data points
- ✅ Shows Bitcoin price changes correctly over time
- ✅ Handles all three scenarios independently

**Key Verification:**
```
Regression: Weekly expenses with monthly precision
Issue: Previously, monthly precision didn't catch all weekly expenses
Expected: 4 weekly expenses in January 2020
Actual: 4 weekly expenses caught ✅

Regression: Balance decreases on expense day
Issue: Data points should reflect expense deductions
Expected: Day 10 balance < Day 9 balance (after rent payment)
Actual: Day 10 balance < Day 9 balance ✅
```

## Verified Calculations

### Bitcoin Price Data
- ✅ 2015-2024 monthly prices (120 data points)
- ✅ Prices range from €220 (2015) to €66,000 (2024)
- ✅ Correct month indexing (January = 0, December = 11)

### Financial Formulas

**Scenario 1 (Euro-Only):**
```
finalBalance = totalSalaryReceived - totalExpensesPaid
```
✅ Verified with multiple test cases

**Scenario 2 (Bitcoin No-Selling):**
```
btcAmount += eurBalance / btcPrice (when eurBalance > 0)
finalBalance = btcAmount × finalBtcPrice
```
✅ Verified with multiple test cases

**Scenario 3 (Bitcoin With-Selling):**
```
If expense > eurCash:
  shortfall = expense - eurCash
  btcToSell = shortfall / btcPrice
  btcAmount -= btcToSell

finalBalance = (btcAmount × btcPrice) + eurCash
```
✅ Verified with multiple test cases

**Inflation Multipliers:**
```
Year N salary = baseSalary × (1 + growthRate)^(N-1)
Year N expense = baseExpense × (1 + inflationRate)^(N-1)
```
✅ Verified with 3-year simulation

**Gain Percentage:**
```
gain% = ((btcBalance - euroBalance) / |euroBalance|) × 100
Special cases: if euroBalance = 0, return 100% or 0% based on btcBalance
```
✅ Verified with all edge cases

## Known Behaviors Confirmed

1. **Negative Balances:** The Euro-only scenario can go negative, but Scenario 3 clamps to zero after depleting all Bitcoin.

2. **Month-End Handling:** Payments scheduled for day 31 automatically adjust to the last day of shorter months (28/29 for Feb, 30 for Apr/Jun/Sep/Nov).

3. **First Year Multiplier:** Inflation and growth multipliers are 1.0 in the first year, then compound annually.

4. **Data Sampling:** Monthly precision samples approximately weekly (every 7 days) plus month changes plus final day to show expense fluctuations.

5. **Chart Performance:** Chart data is sampled to ~50 points maximum regardless of simulation length.
